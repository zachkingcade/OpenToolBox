# OpenToolBox
OpenToolBox is a limited open source project under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Purpose
The purpose of OpenToolBox is to allow a light and easy way for developers and users to combine many "tools". Tools are small contained sections of code that are able to run regardless of other tools.
The tools will each have information passed to them from the main toolbox.

## Stretch Goals
The tools can pass data via an agreed-upon object called a DataShare object. This will be in an advanced menu.
