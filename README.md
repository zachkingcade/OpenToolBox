# OpenToolBox
OpenToolBox is a limited open source project under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Purpose
The purpose of OpenToolBox is to allow a light and easy way for developers and users to combine many "tools". Tools are small contained sections of code that are able to run regardless of other tools.
The tools will each have information passed to them from the main toolbox. Users will be able to enter information to be shared with the tools by the toolbox within a config menu on the main toolbox
page. The primary focus is the speed and flexibility for software developers to put together new tools. Another advantage of the software is that it is built for desktops, meaning you keep all
your data on your computer.

## Stretch Goals
The tools can pass data via an agreed-upon object called a DataShare object. This will be in an advanced menu.
